Some of these file are structured of existing code provided by the teacher hence why there is a warning at the top. 
I have tried to be vague in the repositroy and file naming to deter google searches of future students from copying this work.
This repository is an amalgamation of all the random coding projects and files that I completed while at BSU.
It is a work in progress and I plan on continuing to comment, update, and upload existing and new files to this repository.
