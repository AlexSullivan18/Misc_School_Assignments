My project is successfully added to heroku with function 1 successfully working though i did it through a seperate js file the sample databases are in there function 2's html page is present but does not work when submitted because it does not post to anywhere i could not figure out how to cross refrence dubmitted values against database values. Assignment 3 is not present at all

addAssignment.js is what allows for the messages to be posted when addAssignment.html is updated I included it in the zip
